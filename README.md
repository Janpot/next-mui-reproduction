This is a reproduction for a Next.js issue

1. Run `pnpm install`
1. Run `pnpm dev`
1. Open `http://localhost:3000/`
1. Open browser devtools
1. open `src/app/page.tsx` and replace the content with

   ```tsx
   import { Alert, Button } from "@mui/material";

   export default function Home() {
     return (
       <div>
         <Button>foo</Button>
         <Alert severity="error">This is an error alert â€” check it out!</Alert>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

1. Save

The page reloads and a series of warnings and errors appears:

```

The above error occurred in the <NotFoundErrorBoundary> component.

React will try to recreate this component tree from scratch using the error boundary you provided, ReactDevOverlay.

```
[Fast Refresh] performing full reload

Fast Refresh will perform a full reload when you edit a file that's imported by modules outside of the React rendering tree.
You might have a file which exports a React component but also exports a value that is imported by a non-React component file.
Consider migrating the non-React component export to a separate file and importing it into both files.

It is also possible the parent component of the component you edited is a class component, which disables Fast Refresh.
Fast Refresh requires at least one parent function component in your React tree.
```
